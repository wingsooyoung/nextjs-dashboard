### My Little Blurb

I'm working through this tutorial because I desperately want to rewrite my [FOR X Love Letters](https://github.com/wingsooyoung/OXLoveLetters) project into some kind of React-based framework. 

This example looked useful for my (surprisingly?) _niche use case[^1]_. 

Contains:
- Next.js (duh)
- Typescript
- Tailwind
- Vercel
- Postgres

<sub>My FXLL site so far only has basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript plus Nunjucks/Eleventy thrown in for some templating (and because the only example I could find that even remotely resembled what I was trying to accomplish used these tools). It's a little bit daunting to learn three new ... well not new languages entirely, but three new dialects. Also because this example uses Vercel, I might end up switching away from Netlify too ðŸ˜­ But ISTG I was going to have to learn all this stuff eventually... why not speedrun that process by learning them all at the same time... lol ðŸ¥²</sub>


[^1]: That use case being: 1) Accept user input via a form, 2) Store user input in some database, 3) Take each input and display on the website as a "postcard", 4) Allow admin to approve or deny each "postcard" for moderation purposes, and 5) Create a gallery of all approved "postcards" for the public to see. Trust me, trying to find a Basic Example of accepting and displaying uniquely formatted user-submitted content is incredibly difficult.
